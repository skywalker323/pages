You are given two integer arrays of the same length`nums1`and`nums2`. In one operation, you are allowed to swap`nums1[i]`with`nums2[i]`.

* For example, if
  `nums1 = [1,2,3,`
  `8`
  `]`
  , and
  `nums2 = [5,6,7,`
  `4`
  `]`
  , you can swap the element at
  `i = 3`
  to obtain
  `nums1 = [1,2,3,4]`
  and
  `nums2 = [5,6,7,8]`
  .

Return_the minimum number of needed operations to make_`nums1`_and_`nums2`_**strictly increasing**_. The test cases are generated so that the given input always makes it possible.

An array`arr`is**strictly increasing**if and only if`arr[0] < arr[1] < arr[2] < ... < arr[arr.length - 1]`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
 nums1 = [1,3,5,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,7]

Output:
 1

Explanation:

Swap nums1[3] and nums2[3]. Then the sequences are:
nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7] and nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
which are both strictly increasing.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input:
 nums1 = [0,3,5,8,9], nums2 = [2,1,4,6,9]

Output:
 1
```

/*We easily see that the position of any element of the two provided arrays is fixed, either we choose to swap it or keep it as original. Thus, at any position there are 2 states we can maintain, I call them keep and swap (keep if we choose to keep the elements as original, and swap is the opposite case).

At any position we can choose to keep it as original if the value of the element of nums1 greater than the previous one in the same array, the same for the element of nums2. In the other hand, we can choose to swap the elements of the 2 arrays if and only if the value of the element of nums1 is greater than the element of nums2 which has position less than position of the mentioned element of nums1 array.

As the statement of this problem, we need to make the 2 provided arrays strictly increasing. And they guaranteed that the test case we received is always possible to find the minimum result. Therefore, there are at least one state we can choose at any position (keep or swap the elements).

We can use the dynamic programming technique to solve this problem. The base state is at position 0 and the result is the minimum value of 2 state of the last.
