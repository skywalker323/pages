# 16 3Sum Closest – Medium

### Problem:

Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

```
For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Thoughts:

This is almost the same problem with 3Sum. The only difference is the checking condition. Instead of a + b + c = 0, check if \(a + b + c – target\) is min.

### Solutions:

```java
int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int diff = INT_MAX;
        int sz = nums.size();
        sort(begin(nums), end(nums));
        for (int i = 0; i < sz && diff != 0; ++i) {
            int lo = i + 1;
            int hi = sz - 1;
            while (lo < hi) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[lo] + nums[hi];
                if (abs(target - sum) < abs(diff)) {
                    diff = target - sum;
                }
                if (sum < target) {
                    ++lo;
                } else {
                    --hi;
                }
            }
        }
        return target - diff;
    }
```
