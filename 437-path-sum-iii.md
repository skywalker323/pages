# 437 Path Sum III

### Problem

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards \(traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes\).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

```
Example:

root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

### Solutions

```java
This is a nice problem, as it is the composition of 2 classical ones: getting a series of values traversing a tree and verifying if any of those numbers have one or more subarrays summing up to a given targetSum.

The latter problem is here if you want a warm up and here I explained how it worked in more detail.

So my approach followed basically these 2 bits of logic, doing a composition of a DFS based tree traversal and at each iteration checking if the very last value mins the targetSum were already spotted; I used a vector initially, then moved up to an array to keep track of the already seen values with a huge performance boost.

In my approach I use 3 class variables:

my typical accumulator variable res initialised to 0 to count the number of matching occurrences;
sum that takes the values of targetSum and replaces it in all of my recursive calls (so that I do not have to pass it as a parameter)
seen, as mentioned to keep track of the values I spotted so far and created to hold 1001 values (an initial 0 at root level, plus other potential 1000 different ones, as specified in the specs).
Inside my main function I initialise the values and then, provided the tree is not empty (ie: !root), I call dfs.

This function receives 3 parameters:

a mandatory root, which is the node we are currently exploring;
an optional partialSum value, defaulted to 0 and keeping track of our current partial sum going down a specific branch;
an optional pos to tell us where to put out next value in seen and up to which point browse it (muuuch faster than expanding and reducing a vector, try the alternative code down below!)
We are looking for all the occurrences of values in seen which are partialSum - sum, because it means that said value n plus partialSum would equal sum, and for each such instance we increase res by one.

If we have a ->left branch we do the same with it, passing the update root, partialSum and pos (increased by 1) down as parameters; same thing with a ->right branch, if it exists.

When we are done, we just return res :)

The improved code (using an array for seen):

class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0, sum;
    int seen[1001];
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int partialSum = 0, int pos = 1) {
        // updating partialSum with the current node
        partialSum += root->val;
        // checking if we already found an interval summing up to that
        for (int i = 0; i < pos; i++) if (seen[i] == partialSum - sum) res++;
        // updating seen
        seen[pos] = partialSum;
        // searching potential left and right branches
        if (root->left) dfs(root->left, partialSum, pos + 1);
        if (root->right) dfs(root->right, partialSum, pos + 1);
    }
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        sum = targetSum;
        // seen set with initial value 0 will help us match from the root
        seen[0] = 0;
        if (!root) return res;
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
};
Original approach, vector-based with some extra backtracking logic and going for about a meager ~60% Time, ~50% Space:

class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0, sum;
    // seen set with initial value 0 will help us match from the root
    vector<int> seen = {0};
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int partialSum = 0) {
        // updating partialSum with the current node
        partialSum += root->val;
        // checking if we already found an interval summing up to that
        for (auto n: seen) if (n == partialSum - sum) res++;
        // updating seen
        seen.push_back(partialSum);
        // searching potential left and right branches
        if (root->left) dfs(root->left, partialSum);
        if (root->right) dfs(root->right, partialSum);
        // clearing seen one level, for backtracking purposes
        seen.pop_back();
    }
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        sum = targetSum;
        if (!root) return res;
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
};
Alternative with unordered_map, almost as fast, but with space going down to 20% (I believe it used around 40-50% more space on average):

class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0, sum;
    unordered_map<int, int> seen;
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int partialSum = 0) {
        // updating partialSum with the current node
        partialSum += root->val;
        // checking if we already found an interval summing up to that
        res += seen[partialSum - sum];
        // updating seen
        seen[partialSum]++;
        // searching potential left and right branches
        if (root->left) dfs(root->left, partialSum);
        if (root->right) dfs(root->right, partialSum);
        // clearing seen of the last value, for backtracking purposes
        seen[partialSum]--;
    }
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        sum = targetSum;
        // seen set with initial value 0 will help us match from the root
        seen[0] = 1;
        if (!root) return res;
        dfs(root);
        return res;
    }
};
```
